Description: Utilities for computing measures to assess model quality,
    which are not directly provided by R's 'base' or 'stats' packages. These 
    include e.g. measures like r-squared, intraclass correlation coefficient
    (Nakagawa, Johnson & Schielzeth (2017) <doi:10.1098/rsif.2017.0213>), 
    root mean squared error or functions to check models for overdispersion, 
    singularity or zero-inflation and more. Functions apply to a large variety of
    regression models, including generalized linear models, mixed effects models
    and Bayesian models.
