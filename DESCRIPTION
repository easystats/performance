Description: Utilities for computing measures to assess model quality,
    which are not directly provided by R's 'base' or 'stats' packages.
    These include e.g. measures like r-squared, intraclass correlation
    coefficient (Nakagawa, Johnson & Schielzeth (2017)
    <doi:10.1098/rsif.2017.0213>), root mean squared error or functions to
    check models for overdispersion, singularity or zero-inflation and
    more. Functions apply to a large variety of regression models,
    including generalized linear models, mixed effects models and Bayesian
    models.
