# performance 0.8.1

## Changes to functions

  the results (and no longer generates a plot). A `plot()` method was added
  to generate plots.
  
* The `plot()` output for `check_model()` was revised:

  - For binomial models, the constant variance plot was omitted, and a binned
    residuals plot included.

    posterior predictive check plot.

  response variables.

* `check_zeroinflation()` now also works for `lme4::glmer.nb()` models.

  requested.

  _bayesplot_ package, where the generic is located.

## General

* Minor revisions to wording for messages from some of the check-functions.

* `posterior_predictive_check()` and `check_predictions()` were added as aliases
  for `pp_check()`.

## New functions

* `check_multimodal()` and `check_heterogeneity_bias()`. These functions will
  be removed from the _parameters_ packages in the future.

* `r2()` for linear models can now compute confidence intervals, via the `ci`
  argument.

## Bug fixes

  non-syntactic names.
