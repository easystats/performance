#' Check suitability of data for Factor Analysis (FA) with Bartlett's Test of Sphericity and KMO
#'
#' This checks whether the data is appropriate for Factor Analysis (FA) by
#' running the Bartlett's Test of Sphericity and the Kaiser, Meyer, Olkin (KMO)
#' Measure of Sampling Adequacy (MSA). See **details** below for more information
#' about the interpretation and meaning of each test.

#' @details
#' ### Bartlett's Test of Sphericity
#'
#' Bartlett's (1951) test of sphericity tests whether a matrix (of correlations)
#' is significantly different from an identity matrix (filled with 0). It tests
#' whether the correlation coefficients are all 0. The test computes the
#' probability that the correlation matrix has significant correlations among at
#' least some of the variables in a dataset, a prerequisite for factor analysis
#' to work.
#'
#' While it is often suggested to check whether Bartlettâ€™s test of sphericity is
#' significant before starting with factor analysis, one needs to remember that
#' the test is testing a pretty extreme scenario (that all correlations are non-significant).
#' As the sample size increases, this test tends to be always significant, which
#' makes it not particularly useful or informative in well-powered studies.
#'
#' ### Kaiser, Meyer, Olkin (KMO)
#'
#' *(Measure of Sampling Adequacy (MSA) for Factor Analysis.)*
#'
#' Kaiser (1970) introduced a Measure of Sampling Adequacy (MSA), later modified
#' by Kaiser and Rice (1974). The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) statistic, which can
#' vary from 0 to 1, indicates the degree to which each variable in a set is
#' predicted without error by the other variables.
#'
#' A value of 0 indicates that the sum of partial correlations is large relative
#' to the sum correlations, indicating factor analysis is likely to be
#' inappropriate. A KMO value close to 1 indicates that the sum of partial
#' correlations is not large relative to the sum of correlations and so factor
#' analysis should yield distinct and reliable factors. It means that patterns
#' of correlations are relatively compact, and so factor analysis should yield
#' distinct and reliable factors. Values smaller than 0.5 suggest that you should
#' either collect more data or rethink which variables to include.
#'
#' Kaiser (1974) suggested that KMO > .9 were marvelous, in the .80s,
#' meritorious, in the .70s, middling, in the .60s, mediocre, in the .50s,
#' miserable, and less than .5, unacceptable. Hair et al. (2006) suggest
#' accepting a value > 0.5. Values between 0.5 and 0.7 are mediocre, and values
#' between 0.7 and 0.8 are good.
#'
#' Variables with individual KMO values below 0.5 could be considered for
#' exclusion them from the analysis (note that you would need to re-compute the
#' KMO indices as they are dependent on the whole dataset).
#'
#' @param x A dataframe or a correlation matrix. If the latter is passed, `n`
#'   must be provided.
#' @param n If a correlation matrix was passed, the number of observations must
#'   be specified.
#' @param ... Arguments passed to or from other methods.
