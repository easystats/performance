\arguments{
\item{x}{A data frame or a mixed model. See details and examples.}

\item{...}{Arguments passed to other methods}

\item{select}{Character vector (or formula) with names of variables to select
that should be checked. If \code{NULL}, selects all variables (except those in
\code{by}).}

\item{by}{Character vector (or formula) with the name of the variable that
indicates the group- or cluster-ID. For cross-classified or nested designs,
\code{by} can also identify two or more variables as group- or cluster-IDs.}

\item{include_by}{When there is more than one grouping variable, should they
be check against each other?}

\item{numeric_as_factor}{Should numeric variables be tested as factors?}

\item{tolerance_numeric}{The amount of variation (calculated by \code{var()}, i.e.
the variance of a variable) that is tolerated to indicate no within- or
between-effect.}

\item{tolerance_factor}{How should a non-numeric variable be identified as
varying only "within" a grouping variable? Options are:
\itemize{
\item \code{"crossed"} - if all groups have all unique values of X.
\item \code{"balanced"} - if all groups have all unique values of X, \emph{with equal
frequency}.

\value{
A data frame with Group, Variable, Variation and Design columns.

\description{
Checks if variables vary within and/or between levels of grouping variables.
This function can be used to infer the hierarchical Design of a given
dataset, or detect any predictors that might cause heterogeneity bias (\emph{Bell
and Jones, 2015}). Use \code{summary()} on the output if you are mainly interested
if and which predictors are possibly affected by heterogeneity bias.
}
\details{
This function attempt to identify the hierarchical design of a dataset with
respect to grouping variables (\code{by}). If \code{x} is a (mixed effect) model, the
variability of the fixed effects predictors are checked with respect to the
random grouping variables.
\subsection{Numeric variables}{

Numeric variables are portioned via \code{\link[datawizard:demean]{datawizard::demean()}} to their within-
and between-group components. Then, the variance for each variable's within-
and between-group component is calculated. Variables with within-group
variance larger than \code{tolerance_numeric} are labeled as \emph{within}, variables
with a between-group variance larger than \code{tolerance_numeric} are labeled as
\emph{between}, and variables with both variances larger than \code{tolerance_numeric}
are labeled as \emph{both}.

Setting \code{numeric_as_factor = TRUE} causes numeric variables to be tested
using the following criteria.
}

\subsection{Non-numeric variables}{

These variables can have one of the following three labels:
\itemize{
\item \emph{between} - the variable is fixed (has exactly one unique, constant value)
for each group.
\item \emph{within} - the variable is \emph{crossed} with the grouping variable - each
value appear within each group. The \code{tolerance_factor} argument controls if
full balance is also required.
\item \emph{both} - the variable is partially nested within the grouping variable (or,
when \code{tolerance_factor = "balanced"} the variable is fully crossed, but not
perfectly balanced).
}

Additionally, the design of non-numeric variables is also checked to see if
they are nested within the groups or is they are crossed. This is indicated
in the column \code{Design}.
}

\subsection{Heterogeneity bias}{

Variables that vary both within and between groups can cause a heterogeneity
bias (\emph{Bell and Jones, 2015}). It is recommended to center (person-mean
centering) those variables to avoid this bias. See \code{\link[datawizard:demean]{datawizard::demean()}}
for further details. Use \code{summary()} to get a short text result that indicates
if and which predictors are possibly affected by heterogeneity bias.
