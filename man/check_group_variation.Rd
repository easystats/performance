\title{Check variables for within- and/or between-group variation}
\usage{
check_group_variation(
  x,
  select = NULL,
  by = NULL,
  nested = FALSE,
  tolerance = 1e-04
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A data frame.}

\item{select}{Character vector (or formula) with names of variables to select
that should be checked.}

\item{by}{Character vector (or formula) with the name of the variable that
indicates the group- or cluster-ID. For cross-classified or nested designs,
\code{by} can also identify two or more variables as group- or cluster-IDs. If
the data is nested and should be treated as such, set \code{nested = TRUE}. Else,
if \code{by} defines two or more variables and \code{nested = FALSE}, a cross-classified
design is assumed.

For nested designs, \code{by} can be:
\itemize{
\item a character vector with the name of the variable that indicates the
levels, ordered from \emph{highest} level to \emph{lowest} (e.g.
\code{by = c("L4", "L3", "L2")}.
\item a character vector with variable names in the format \code{by = "L4/L3/L2"},
where the levels are separated by \code{/}.
}}

\item{nested}{Logical, if \code{TRUE}, the data is treated as nested. If \code{FALSE},
the data is treated as cross-classified. Only applies if \code{by} contains more
than one variable.}

\item{tolerance}{The amount of variation (calculated by \code{var()}, i.e. the
variance of a variable) that is tolerated to indicate no within- or
between-effect.}
}
\value{
A list with at most three elements, \code{within}, \code{between}, and \code{both},
where each element contains the name of variables that have one of these
effects.
}
\description{
\code{check_group_variation()} checks if variables a within- and/or between-effect,
i.e. if they vary within or between certain groups.
}
\details{
This function calls \code{\link[datawizard:demean]{datawizard::demean()}} to calculate the within- and
between-effects of variables specified in \code{select}, based on the groups
indicated in \code{by}. Then, the variance for each variable's within- and
between-effect is calculated. If the variance is larger than \code{tolerance},
a within- or between-effect is detected.

\examples{
set.seed(1234)
dat <- data.frame(
  id = rep(letters, each = 3),
  between_num = rep(rnorm(26), each = 3),
  within1_num = rep(rnorm(3), times = 26),
  within2_num = rep(rnorm(3), times = 26),
  both_num = rnorm(3 * 26)

  dat,
  select = c("between_num", "innen_num", "within_num", "both_num"),
  by = "id"
