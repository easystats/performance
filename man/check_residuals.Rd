\title{Check uniformity of simulated residuals}
\usage{
check_residuals(x, ...)
}
\description{
\code{check_residuals()} checks generalized linear (mixed) models for uniformity
of randomized quantile residuals, which can be used to identify typical model
misspecification problems, such as over/underdispersion, zero-inflation, and
residual spatial and temporal autocorrelation.
