\usage{
\method{model_performance}{merMod}(
  model,
  metrics = "all",
  estimator = "REML",
  verbose = TRUE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A mixed effects model.}

\item{metrics}{Can be \code{"all"}, \code{"common"} or a character vector of
metrics to be computed (some of \code{c("AIC", "AICc", "BIC", "R2", "ICC", "RMSE", "SIGMA", "LOGLOSS", "SCORE")}). \code{"common"} will compute AIC,
BIC, R2, ICC and RMSE.}

\item{estimator}{Only for linear models. Corresponds to the different
estimators for the standard deviation of the errors. If \code{estimator = "ML"}
(default), the scaling is done by n (the biased ML estimator), which is
then equivalent to using \code{AIC(logLik())}. Setting it to \code{"REML"} will give
the same results as \code{AIC(logLik(..., REML = TRUE))}.}

\item{verbose}{Toggle warnings and messages.}

\item{...}{Arguments passed to or from other methods.}
}
\value{
A data frame (with one row) and one column per "index" (see
\code{metrics}).
}
\description{
Compute indices of model performance for mixed models.
}
\details{
\subsection{Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC)}{
This method returns the \emph{adjusted ICC} only, as this is typically of
interest when judging the variance attributed to the random effects part of
the model (see also \code{\link[=icc]{icc()}}).
}
\subsection{REML versus ML estimator}{
The default behaviour of \code{model_performance()} when computing AIC or BIC of
linear mixed model from package \strong{lme4} is the same as for \code{AIC()} or
\code{BIC()} (i.e. \code{estimator = "REML"}). However, for model comparison using
\code{compare_performance()} sets \code{estimator = "ML"} by default, because
\emph{comparing} information criteria based on REML fits is usually not valid
(unless all models have the same fixed effects). Thus, make sure to set
the correct estimator-value when looking at fit-indices or comparing model
fits.
}
\subsection{Other performance indices}{
Furthermore, see 'Details' in \code{\link[=model_performance.lm]{model_performance.lm()}} for more details
on returned indices.
