\title{Percentage of Correct Predictions}
\usage{
performance_pcp(model, ci = 0.95, method = "Herron", verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{Model with binary outcome.}

\item{ci}{The level of the confidence interval.}

\item{method}{Name of the method to calculate the PCP (see 'Details').
Default is \code{"Herron"}. May be abbreviated.}

\item{verbose}{Toggle off warnings.}
}
\value{
A list with several elements: the percentage of correct predictions
of the full and the null model, their confidence intervals, as well as the
chi-squared and p-value from the Likelihood-Ratio-Test between the full and
null model.
}
\description{
Percentage of correct predictions (PCP) for models
with binary outcome.
}
\details{
\code{method = "Gelman-Hill"} (or \code{"gelman_hill"}) computes the
PCP based on the proposal from \emph{Gelman and Hill 2017, 99}, which is
defined as the proportion of cases for which the deterministic prediction
is wrong, i.e. the proportion where the predicted probability is above 0.5,
although y=0 (and vice versa) (see also \emph{Herron 1999, 90}).

\code{method = "Herron"} (or \code{"herron"}) computes a modified version
of the PCP (\emph{Herron 1999, 90-92}), which is the sum of predicted
probabilities, where y=1, plus the sum of 1 - predicted probabilities,
where y=0, divided by the number of observations. This approach is said to
be more accurate.

The PCP ranges from 0 to 1, where values closer to 1 mean that the model
predicts the outcome better than models with an PCP closer to 0. In general,
the PCP should be above 0.5 (i.e. 50\\%), the closer to one, the better.
Furthermore, the PCP of the full model should be considerably above
the null model's PCP.

The likelihood-ratio test indicates whether the model has a significantly
better fit than the null-model (in such cases, p < 0.05).
