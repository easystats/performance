\description{
These functions provide information about the reliability of
group-level estimates (i.e., random effects) in mixed models. They are useful
to assess whether there the predictors yield consistent group-level variability.
"Group-level" can refer, for instance, to different participants in a study,
and the predictors to the effect of some experimental condition.

The conceptually related functions are implemented, \code{performance_reliability()},
based on Rouder & Mehrvarz (2024), and \code{performance_dvour()} (d-vour), based on the
Variability-Over-Uncertainty Ratio between random effects coefficient variability
and their assocaited uncertainty.
}
\details{
\subsection{Reliability (Signal-to-Noise Ratio)}{

\code{performance_reliability()} estimates the reliability of random effects (intercepts and slopes)
in mixed-effects models using variance decomposition. This method follows the \strong{hierarchical modeling}
framework of Rouder & Mehrvarz (2024), defining reliability as the \strong{signal-to-noise variance ratio}:

\deqn{\gamma^2 = \frac{\sigma_B^2}{\sigma_B^2 + \sigma_W^2}}

where:
\itemize{
\item \eqn{\sigma_B^2} is the \strong{between-subject variance} (i.e., variability across groups).
\item \eqn{\sigma_W^2} is the \strong{within-subject variance} (i.e., trial-level measurement noise).
}

This metric quantifies \strong{how much observed variability is due to actual differences between groups},
rather than measurement error or within-group fluctuations.

To account for \strong{trial count (\eqn{L})}, reliability is adjusted following:

\deqn{E(r) = \frac{\gamma^2}{\gamma^2 + 1/L}}

where \eqn{L} is the number of \strong{observations per random effect level} (note
that Rouder (2024) recommends 2/L to adjust for contrast effects).
}

\subsection{Variability-Over-Uncertainty Ratio (d-vour)}{

\code{performance_dvour()} computes an alternative reliability measure based on the \strong{ratio of observed variability
to uncertainty in random effect estimates}. This is defined as:

\deqn{\text{D-vour} = \frac{\sigma_B^2}{\sigma_B^2 + \mu_{\text{SE}}^2}}

where:
\itemize{
\item \eqn{\sigma_B^2} is the \strong{between-group variability} (computed as the SD of the random effect estimates).
\item \eqn{\mu_{\text{SE}}^2} is the \strong{mean squared uncertainty} in random effect estimates (i.e., the average uncertainty).
}
\subsection{Interpretation:}{
\itemize{
\item \strong{D-vour > 0.75}: Strong group-level effects (between-group variance is at least 3× greater than uncertainty).
\item \strong{D-vour ≈ 0.5}: Within-group and between-group variability are similar; effect may be unstable.
\item \strong{D-vour < 0.5}: Measurement noise dominates; effects should be interpreted with caution.
}

While d-vour shares some similarity to Rouder's Reliability, it does not explicitly model
within-group trial-level noise and is only based on the random effect estimates, and can thus
be not very accurate when there is not a lot of random factor groups.
