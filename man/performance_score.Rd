\title{Proper Scoring Rules}
\usage{
performance_score(model, verbose = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{Model with binary or count outcome.}

\item{verbose}{Toggle off warnings.}

\item{...}{Arguments from other functions, usually only used internally.}
}
\value{
A list with three elements, the logarithmic, quadratic/Brier and spherical score.
}
\description{
Calculates the logarithmic, quadratic/Brier and spherical score
from a model with binary or count outcome.
}
\details{
Proper scoring rules can be used to evaluate the quality of model
predictions and model fit. \code{performance_score()} calculates the logarithmic,
quadratic/Brier and spherical scoring rules. The spherical rule takes values
in the interval \verb{[0, 1]}, with values closer to 1 indicating a more
accurate model, and the logarithmic rule in the interval \verb{[-Inf, 0]},
with values closer to 0 indicating a more accurate model.

For \code{stan_lmer()} and \code{stan_glmer()} models, the predicted values
are based on \code{posterior_predict()}, instead of \code{predict()}. Thus,
results may differ more than expected from their non-Bayesian counterparts
in \strong{lme4}.
