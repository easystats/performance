\title{Nakagawa's R2 for mixed models}
\usage{
r2_nakagawa(
  model,
  by_group = FALSE,
  tolerance = 1e-05,
  ci = NULL,
  iterations = 100,
  ci_method = NULL,
  verbose = TRUE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A mixed effects model.}

\item{by_group}{Logical, if \code{TRUE}, returns the explained variance
at different levels (if there are multiple levels). This is essentially
similar to the variance reduction approach by \emph{Hox (2010), pp. 69-78}.}

\item{tolerance}{Tolerance for singularity check of random effects, to decide
whether to compute random effect variances for the conditional r-squared
or not. Indicates up to which value the convergence result is accepted. When
\code{r2_nakagawa()} returns a warning, stating that random effect variances
can't be computed (and thus, the conditional r-squared is \code{NA}),
decrease the tolerance-level. See also \code{\link[=check_singularity]{check_singularity()}}.}

\item{ci}{Confidence resp. credible interval level. For \code{icc()} and \code{r2()},
confidence intervals are based on bootstrapped samples from the ICC resp.
R2 value. See \code{iterations}.}

\item{iterations}{Number of bootstrap-replicates when computing confidence
intervals for the ICC or R2.}

\item{ci_method}{Character string, indicating the bootstrap-method. Should
be \code{NULL} (default), in which case \code{lme4::bootMer()} is used for
bootstrapped confidence intervals. However, if bootstrapped intervals cannot
be calculated this was, try \code{ci_method = "boot"}, which falls back to
\code{boot::boot()}. This may successfully return bootstrapped confidence intervals,
but bootstrapped samples may not be appropriate for the multilevel structure
of the model. There is also an option \code{ci_method = "analytical"}, which tries
to calculate analytical confidence assuming a chi-squared distribution.
However, these intervals are rather inaccurate and often too narrow. It is
recommended to calculate bootstrapped confidence intervals for mixed models.}

\item{verbose}{Toggle warnings and messages.}

\item{...}{Arguments passed down to \code{brms::posterior_predict()}.}
}
\value{
A list with the conditional and marginal R2 values.
}
\description{
Compute the \emph{marginal} and \emph{conditional} r-squared value for
mixed effects models with complex random effects structures.
}
\details{
Marginal and conditional r-squared values for mixed models are calculated
based on \emph{Nakagawa et al. (2017)}. For more details on the computation of
the variances, see \code{?insight::get_variance}. The random effect variances are
actually the mean random effect variances, thus the r-squared value is also
appropriate for mixed models with random slopes or nested random effects
(see \emph{Johnson, 2014}).
\itemize{
\item \strong{Conditional R2}: takes both the fixed and random effects into account.
\item \strong{Marginal R2}: considers only the variance of the fixed effects.
}

The contribution of random effects can be deduced by subtracting the
marginal R2 from the conditional R2 or by computing the \code{\link[=icc]{icc()}}.
