\begin{abstract}
Beyond the challenge of keeping up-to-date with current best practices
regarding the diagnosis and treatment of outliers, an additional
difficulty arises concerning the mathematical implementation of the
recommended methods. In this paper, we provide an overview of current
recommandations and best practices and demonstrate how they can easily
and conveniently be implemented in the R statistical computing software,
using the \emph{\{performance\}} package of the \emph{easystats}
ecosystem. We cover univariate, multivariate, and model-based
statistical outlier detection methods, their recommended threshold,
standard output, and plotting methods. We conclude with recommendations
on the handling of outliers: the different theoretical types of
outliers, whether to exclude or winsorize them, and the importance of
transparency.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

Real-life data often contain observations that can be considered
\emph{abnormal} when compared to the main population. The cause of
it---be it because they belong to a different distribution (originating
from a different generative process) or simply being extreme cases,
statistically rare but not impossible---can be hard to assess, and the
boundaries of ``abnormal'' are hard to define.

Nonetheless, the improper handling of these outliers can substantially
affect statistical model estimations, biasing effect estimations and
weakening the models' predictive performance. It is thus essential to
address this problem in a thoughtful manner. Yet, despite the existence
of established recommendations and guidelines, many researchers still do
not treat outliers in a consistent manner, or do so using inappropriate
strategies (Simmons, Nelson, and Simonsohn 2011; Leys et al. 2013).

One possible reason is that researchers are not aware of the existing
recommendations, or do not know how to implement them using their
analysis software. In this paper, we show how to follow current best
practices for automatic and reproducible statistical outlier detection
(SOD) using R and the \emph{\{performance\}} package (Lüdecke et al.
2021), which is part of the \emph{easystats} ecosystem of packages that
build an R framework for easy statistical modeling, visualization, and
reporting (Lüdecke et al. 2022).

\hypertarget{identifying-outliers}{%
\section{Identifying Outliers}\label{identifying-outliers}}

Although many researchers attempt to identify outliers with measures
based on the mean (e.g., \emph{z} scores), those methods are problematic
because the mean and standard deviation themselves are not robust to the
influence of outliers and they assume normally distributed data (i.e., a
Gaussian distribution). Therefore, current guidelines recommend using
robust methods to identify outliers, such as those relying on the median
as opposed to the mean (Leys et al. 2019, 2013, 2018).

Nonetheless, which exact outlier method to use depends on many factors.
In some cases, eye-gauging odd observations can be an appropriate
solution, though many researchers will favour algorithmic solutions to
detect potential outliers, for example, based on a continuous value
expressing the observation stands out from the others.

One of the factors to consider when selecting an algorithmic outlier
detection method is the statistical test of interest. When using a
regression model, relevant information can be found by identifying
observations that do not fit well with the model. This approach, known
as model-based outliers detection (as outliers are extracted after the
statistical model has been fit), can be contrasted with
distribution-based outliers detection, which is based on the distance
between an observation and the ``center'' of its population. Various
quantification strategies of this distance exist for the latter, both
univariate (involving only one variable at a time) or multivariate
(involving multiple variables).

When no method is readily available to detect model-based outliers, such
as for structural equation modelling (SEM), looking for multivariate
outliers may be of relevance. For simple tests (\emph{t} tests or
correlations) that compare values of the same variable, it can be
appropriate to check for univariate outliers. However, univariate
methods can give false positives since \emph{t} tests and correlations,
ultimately, are also models/multivariable statistics. They are in this
sense more limited, but we show them nonetheless for educational
purposes.

Importantly, whatever approach researchers choose remains a subjective
decision, which usage (and rationale) must be transparently documented
and reproducible (Leys et al. 2019). Researchers should commit (ideally
in a preregistration) to an outlier treatment method before collecting
the data. They should report in the paper their decisions and details of
their methods, as well as any deviation from their original plan. These
transparency practices can help reduce false positives due to excessive
researchers' degrees of freedom (i.e., choice flexibility throughout the
analysis). In the following section, we will go through each of the
mentioned methods and provide examples on how to implement them with R.

\hypertarget{univariate-outliers}{%
\subsection{Univariate Outliers}\label{univariate-outliers}}

Researchers frequently attempt to identify outliers using measures of
deviation from the center of a variable's distribution. One of the most
popular such procedure is the \emph{z} score transformation, which
computes the distance in standard deviation (SD) from the mean. However,
as mentioned earlier, this popular method is not robust. Therefore, for
univariate outliers, it is recommended to use the median along with the
Median Absolute Deviation (MAD), which are more robust than the
interquartile range or the mean and its standard deviation (Leys et al.
2019, 2013).

Researchers can identify outliers based on robust (i.e., MAD-based)
\emph{z} scores using the \texttt{check\_outliers()} function of the
\emph{\{performance\}} package, by specifying
\texttt{method\ =\ "zscore\_robust"}.\footnote{Note that
  \texttt{check\_outliers()} only checks numeric variables.} Although
Leys et al. (2013) suggest a default threshold of 2.5 and Leys et al.
(2019) a threshold of 3, \emph{\{performance\}} uses by default a less
conservative threshold of \textasciitilde3.29.\footnote{3.29 is an
  approximation of the two-tailed critical value for \emph{p}
  \textless{} .001, obtained through
  \texttt{qnorm(p\ =\ 1\ -\ 0.001\ /\ 2)}. We chose this threshold for
  consistency with the thresholds of all our other methods.} That is,
data points will be flagged as outliers if they go beyond +/-
\textasciitilde3.29 MAD. Users can adjust this threshold using the
\texttt{threshold} argument, as demonstrated below.

The row numbers of the detected outliers can be obtained by using
\texttt{which()} on the output object, which can be used for exclusions
for example:

method, meaning it is also possible to visualize the outliers:

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{paper_files/figure-latex/univariate-1} \caption{Visual depiction of outliers using the robust z-score method.}\label{fig:univariate}
\end{figure}

Other univariate methods are available, such as using the interquartile
range (IQR), or based on different intervals, such as the Highest
Density Interval (HDI) or the Bias Corrected and Accelerated Interval
(BCI). These methods are documented and described in the function's
\href{https://easystats.github.io/performance/reference/check_outliers.html}{help
page}.

\hypertarget{multivariate-outliers}{%
\subsection{Multivariate Outliers}\label{multivariate-outliers}}

Univariate outliers can be useful when the focus is on a particular
variable, for instance the reaction time, as extreme values might be
indicative of inattention or non-task-related behavior\footnote{ Note
  that they might not be the optimal way of treating reaction time
  outliers (Ratcliff 1993; Van Zandt and Ratcliff 1995)}.

However, in many scenarios, variables of a data set are not independent,
and an abnormal observation will impact multiple dimensions. For
instance, a participant giving random answers to a questionnaire. In
this case, computing the \emph{z} score for each of the questions might
not lead to satisfactory results. Instead, one might want to look at
these variables together.

One common approach for this is to compute multivariate distance metrics
such as the Mahalanobis distance. Although the Mahalanobis distance is
very popular, just like the regular \emph{z} scores method, it is not
robust and is heavily influenced by the outliers themselves. Therefore,
for multivariate outliers, it is recommended to use the Minimum
Covariance Determinant, a robust version of the Mahalanobis distance
(MCD, Leys et al. 2018, 2019).

In \emph{\{performance\}}'s \texttt{check\_outliers()}, one can use this
approach with \texttt{method\ =\ "mcd"}.\footnote{Our default threshold
  for the MCD method is defined by
  \texttt{stats::qchisq(p\ =\ 1\ -\ 0.001,\ df\ =\ ncol(x))}, which
  again is an approximation of the critical value for \emph{p}
  \textless{} .001 consistent with the thresholds of our other methods.}

\end{figure}

Other multivariate methods are available, such as another type of robust
Mahalanobis distance that in this case relies on an orthogonalized
Gnanadesikan-Kettenring pairwise estimator (Gnanadesikan and Kettenring
1972). These methods are documented and described in the function's
\href{https://easystats.github.io/performance/reference/check_outliers.html}{help
page}.

\hypertarget{model-based-outliers}{%
\subsection{Model-Based Outliers}\label{model-based-outliers}}

Working with regression models creates the possibility of using
model-based SOD methods. These methods rely on the concept of
\emph{leverage}, that is, how much influence a given observation can
have on the model estimates. If few observations have a relatively
strong leverage/influence on the model, one can suspect that the model's
estimates are biased by these observations, in which case flagging them
as outliers could prove helpful (see next section, ``Handling
Outliers'').

In \{performance\}, two such model-based SOD methods are currently
available: Cook's distance, for regular regression models, and Pareto,
for Bayesian models. As such, \texttt{check\_outliers()} can be applied
directly on regression model objects, by simply specifying
\texttt{method\ =\ "cook"} (or \texttt{method\ =\ "pareto"} for Bayesian
models).\footnote{Our default threshold for the Cook method is defined
  by \texttt{stats::qf(0.5,\ ncol(x),\ nrow(x)\ -\ ncol(x))}, which
  again is an approximation of the critical value for \emph{p}
  \textless{} .001 consistent with the thresholds of our other methods.}

\hypertarget{cooks-distance-vs.-mcd}{%
\subsubsection{Cook's Distance vs.~MCD}\label{cooks-distance-vs.-mcd}}

Leys et al. (2018) report a preference for the MCD method over Cook's
distance. This is because Cook's distance removes one observation at a
time and checks its corresponding influence on the model each time (Cook
1977), and flags any observation that has a large influence. In the view
of these authors, when there are several outliers, the process of
removing a single outlier at a time is problematic as the model remains
``contaminated'' or influenced by other possible outliers in the model,
rendering this method suboptimal in the presence of multiple outliers.

However, distribution-based approaches are not a silver bullet either,
and there are cases where the usage of methods agnostic to theoretical
and statistical models of interest might be problematic. For example, a
very tall person would be expected to also be much heavier than average,
but that would still fit with the expected association between height
and weight (i.e., it would be in line with a model such as
\texttt{weight\ \textasciitilde{}\ height}). In contrast, using
multivariate outlier detection methods there may flag this person as
being an outlier---being unusual on two variables, height and
weight---even though the pattern fits perfectly with our predictions.

In the example below, we plot the raw data and see two possible
outliers. The first one falls along the regression line, and is
therefore ``in line'' with our hypothesis. The second one clearly
diverges from the regression line, and therefore we can conclude that
this outlier may have a disproportionate influence on our model.

\end{figure}

Using either the \emph{z}-score or MCD methods, our model-consistent
observation will be incorrectly flagged as an outlier or influential
observation.

In contrast, the model-based detection method displays the desired
behaviour: it correctly flags the person who is very tall but very
light, without flagging the person who is both tall and heavy.

\end{figure}

Finally, unusual observations happen naturally: extreme observations are
expected even when taken from a normal distribution. While statistical
models can integrate this ``expectation'', multivariate outlier methods
might be too conservative, flagging too many observations despite
belonging to the right generative process. For these reasons, we believe
that model-based methods are still preferable to the MCD when using
supported regression models. Additionally, if the presence of multiple
outliers is a significant concern, regression methods that are more
robust to outliers should be considered---like \emph{t} regression or
quantile regression---as they render their precise identification less
critical (McElreath 2020).

\hypertarget{multiple-methods}{%
\subsection{Multiple Methods}\label{multiple-methods}}

An alternative approach that is possible is to combine several methods,
based on the assumption that different methods provide different angles
of looking at the problem. By applying a variety of methods, one can
hope to ``triangulate'' the true outliers (those consistently flagged by
multiple methods) and thus attempt to minimize false positives.

In practice, this approach computes a composite outlier score, formed of
the average of the binary (0 or 1) classification results of each
method. It represents the probability that each observation is
classified as an outlier by at least one method. The default decision
rule classifies rows with composite outlier scores superior or equal to
0.5 as outlier observations (i.e., that were classified as outliers by
at least half of the methods). In \emph{\{performance\}}'s
\texttt{check\_outliers()}, one can use this approach by including all
desired methods in the corresponding argument.

\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
#> [1] 1501 1502
\end{verbatim}

Outliers (counts or per variables) for individual methods can then be
obtained through attributes. For example:

\begin{Shaded}

\end{verbatim}

An example sentence for reporting the usage of the composite method
could be:

\begin{quote}
Based on a composite outlier score (see the `check\_outliers()' function
in the `performance' R package, (Lüdecke et al. 2021)) obtained via the
joint application of multiple outliers detection algorithms ((a) median
absolute deviation (MAD)-based robust \emph{z} scores, (Leys et al.
2013); (b) Mahalanobis minimum covariance determinant (MCD), (Leys et
al. 2019); and (c) Cook's distance, (Cook 1977)), we excluded two
participants that were classified as outliers by at least half of the
methods used.
\end{quote}

\hypertarget{handling-outliers}{%
\section{Handling Outliers}\label{handling-outliers}}

The above section demonstrated how to identify outliers using the
\texttt{check\_outliers()} function in the \emph{\{performance\}}
package. But what should we do with these outliers once identified?
Although it is common to automatically discard any observation that has
been marked as ``an outlier'' as if it might infect the rest of the data
with its statistical ailment, we believe that the use of SOD methods is
but one step in the get-to-know-your-data pipeline; a researcher or
analyst's \emph{domain knowledge} must be involved in the decision of
how to deal with observations marked as outliers by means of SOD.
Indeed, automatic tools can help detect outliers, but they are nowhere
near perfect. Although they can be useful to flag suspect data, they can
have misses and false alarms, and they cannot replace human eyes and
proper vigilance from the researcher. If you do end up manually
inspecting your data for outliers, it can be helpful to think of
outliers as belonging to different types of outliers, or categories,
which can help decide what to do with a given outlier.

\hypertarget{error-interesting-and-random-outliers}{%
\subsection{Error, Interesting, and Random
Outliers}\label{error-interesting-and-random-outliers}}

Leys et al. (2019) distinguish between error outliers, interesting
outliers, and random outliers. \emph{Error outliers} are likely due to
human error and should be corrected before data analysis or outright
removed since they are invalid observations. \emph{Interesting outliers}
are not due to technical error and may be of theoretical interest; it
might thus be relevant to investigate them further even though they
should be removed from the current analysis of interest. \emph{Random
outliers} are assumed to be due to chance alone and to belong to the
correct distribution and, therefore, should be retained.

It is recommended to \emph{keep} observations which are expected to be
part of the distribution of interest, even if they are outliers (Leys et
al. 2019). However, if it is suspected that the outliers belong to an
alternative distribution, then those observations could have a large
impact on the results and call into question their robustness,
especially if significance is conditional on their inclusion.

On the other hand, there are also outliers that cannot be detected by
statistical tools, but should be found and removed. For example, if we
are studying the effects of X on Y among teenagers and we have one
observation from a 20-year-old, this observation might not be a
\emph{statistical outlier}, but it is an outlier in the \emph{context}
of our research, and should be discarded to allow for valid inferences.

\hypertarget{winsorization}{%
\subsection{Winsorization}\label{winsorization}}

\emph{Removing} outliers can in this case be a valid strategy, and
ideally one would report results with and without outliers to see the
extent of their impact on results. This approach however can reduce
statistical power. Therefore, some propose a \emph{recoding} approach,
namely, winsorization: bringing outliers back within acceptable limits
(e.g., 3 MADs, Tukey and McLaughlin 1963). However, if possible, it is
recommended to collect enough data so that even after removing outliers,
there is still sufficient statistical power without having to resort to
winsorization (Leys et al. 2019).

The \emph{easystats} ecosystem makes it easy to incorporate this step
into your workflow through the \texttt{winsorize()} function of
\emph{\{datawizard\}}, a lightweight R package to facilitate data
wrangling and statistical transformations (Patil et al. 2022). This
procedure will bring back univariate outliers within the limits of
`acceptable' values, based either on the percentile, the \emph{z} score,
or its robust alternative based on the MAD.

\hypertarget{the-importance-of-transparency}{%
\subsection{The Importance of
Transparency}\label{the-importance-of-transparency}}

Once again, it is a critical part of a sound outlier treatment that
regardless of which SOD method used, it should be reported in a
reproducible manner. Ideally, the handling of outliers should be
specified \emph{a priori} with as much detail as possible, and
preregistered, to limit researchers' degrees of freedom and therefore
risks of false positives (Leys et al. 2019). This is especially true
given that interesting outliers and random outliers are often times hard
to distinguish in practice. Thus, researchers should always prioritize
transparency and report all of the following information: (a) how many
outliers were identified; (b) according to which method and criteria,
(c) using which function of which R package (if applicable), and (d) how
they were handled (excluded or winsorized, if the latter, using what
threshold). If at all possible, (e) the corresponding code script along
with the data should be shared on a public repository like the Open
Science Framework (OSF), so that the exclusion criteria can be
reproduced precisely.

\hypertarget{conclusion}{%
\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}}

In this paper, we have showed how to investigate outliers using the
\texttt{check\_outliers()} function of the \emph{\{performance\}}
package while following current good practices. However, best practice
for outlier treatment does not stop at using appropriate statistical
algorithms, but entails respecting existing recommendations, such as
preregistration, reproducibility, consistency, transparency, and
justification. Ideally, one would additionally also report the package,
function, and threshold used (linking to the full code when possible).
We hope that this paper and the accompanying \texttt{check\_outlier()}
function of \emph{easystats} will help researchers engage in good
research practices while providing a smooth outlier detection
experience.
