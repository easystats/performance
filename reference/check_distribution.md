# Classify the distribution of a model-family using machine learning

Choosing the right distributional family for regression models is
essential to get more accurate estimates and standard errors. This
function may help to check a models' distributional family and see if
the model-family probably should be reconsidered. Since it is difficult
to exactly predict the correct model family, consider this function as
somewhat experimental.

## Usage

``` r
check_distribution(model)
```

## Arguments

- model:

  Typically, a model (that should response to
  [`residuals()`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/residuals.html)). May also be
  a numeric vector.

## Details

This function uses an internal random forest model to classify the
distribution from a model-family. Currently, following distributions are
trained (i.e. results of `check_distribution()` may be one of the
following): `"bernoulli"`, `"beta"`, `"beta-binomial"`, `"binomial"`,
`"cauchy"`, `"chi"`, `"exponential"`, `"F"`, `"gamma"`, `"half-cauchy"`,
`"inverse-gamma"`, `"lognormal"`, `"normal"`, `"negative binomial"`,
`"negative binomial (zero-inflated)"`, `"pareto"`, `"poisson"`,
`"poisson (zero-inflated)"`, `"tweedie"`, `"uniform"` and `"weibull"`.  
  
Note the similarity between certain distributions according to shape,
skewness, etc. Thus, the predicted distribution may not be perfectly
representing the distributional family of the underlying fitted model,
or the response value.  
  
There is a [`plot()`](https://rdrr.io/r/graphics/plot.default.html)
method, which shows the probabilities of all predicted distributions,
however, only if the probability is greater than zero.

## Note

This function is somewhat experimental and might be improved in future
releases. The final decision on the model-family should also be based on
theoretical aspects and other information about the data and the
model.  
  
There is also a
[[`plot()`](https://rdrr.io/r/graphics/plot.default.html)-method](https://easystats.github.io/see/articles/performance.html)
implemented in the [see-package](https://easystats.github.io/see/).

## Examples

``` r
data(sleepstudy, package = "lme4")
model <<- lme4::lmer(Reaction ~ Days + (Days | Subject), sleepstudy)
check_distribution(model)
#> # Distribution of Model Family
#> 
#> Predicted Distribution of Residuals

#>                Distribution Probability
#>                      cauchy         91%
#>                       gamma          6%
#>  neg. binomial (zero-infl.)          3%
