# Check variables for within- and/or between-group variation

Checks if variables vary within and/or between levels of grouping
variables. This function can be used to infer the hierarchical Design of
a given dataset, or detect any predictors that might cause heterogeneity
bias (*Bell and Jones, 2015*). Use
[`summary()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/summary.html) on the output if you
are mainly interested if and which predictors are possibly affected by
heterogeneity bias.

## Usage

``` r
check_group_variation(x, ...)

# Default S3 method
check_group_variation(x, ...)

# S3 method for class 'data.frame'
check_group_variation(
  x,
  select = NULL,
  by = NULL,
  include_by = FALSE,
  numeric_as_factor = FALSE,
  tolerance_numeric = 1e-04,
  tolerance_factor = "crossed",
  ...
)

# S3 method for class 'check_group_variation'
summary(object, flatten = FALSE, ...)
```

## Arguments

- x:

  A data frame or a mixed model. See details and examples.

- ...:

  Arguments passed to other methods

- select:

  Character vector (or formula) with names of variables to select that
  should be checked. If `NULL`, selects all variables (except those in
  `by`).

- by:

  Character vector (or formula) with the name of the variable that
  indicates the group- or cluster-ID. For cross-classified or nested
  designs, `by` can also identify two or more variables as group- or
  cluster-IDs.

- include_by:

  When there is more than one grouping variable, should they be check
  against each other?

- numeric_as_factor:

  Should numeric variables be tested as factors?

- tolerance_numeric:

  The minimal percent of variation (observed
  [icc](https://easystats.github.io/performance/reference/icc.md)) that
  is tolerated to indicate no within- or no between-effect.

- tolerance_factor:

  How should a non-numeric variable be identified as varying *only*
  "within" a grouping variable? Options are:

  - `"crossed"` - if all groups have all unique values of X.

  - `"balanced"` - if all groups have all unique values of X, *with
    equal frequency*.

- object:

  result from `check_group_variation()`

- flatten:

  Logical, if `TRUE`, the values are returned as character vector, not
  as list. Duplicated values are removed.

## Value

A data frame with Group, Variable, Variation and Design columns.

## Details

This function attempt to identify the variability of a set of variables
(`select`) with respect to one or more grouping variables (`by`). If `x`
is a (mixed effect) model, the variability of the fixed effects
predictors are checked with respect to the random grouping variables.  
  
Generally, a variable is considered to vary *between* groups if is
correlated with those groups, and to vary *within* groups if it not a
constant within at least one group.

### Numeric variables

Numeric variables are partitioned via
[`datawizard::demean()`](https://easystats.github.io/datawizard/reference/demean.html)
to their within- and between-group components. Then, the variance for
each of these two component is calculated. Variables with within-group
variance larger than `tolerance_numeric` are labeled as *within*,
variables with a between-group variance larger than `tolerance_numeric`
are labeled as *between*, and variables with both variances larger than
`tolerance_numeric` are labeled as *both*.

Setting `numeric_as_factor = TRUE` causes numeric variables to be tested
using the following criteria.

### Non-numeric variables

These variables can have one of the following three labels:

- *between* - the variable is correlated with the groups, *and* is fixed
  within each group (each group has exactly one unique, constant value)

- *within* - the variable is *crossed* with the grouping variable, such
  that all possible values appear within each group. The
  `tolerance_factor` argument controls if full balance is also required.

- *both* - the variable is correlated with the groups, but also varies
  within each group but is not fully crossed (or, when
  `tolerance_factor = "balanced"` the variable is fully crossed, but not
  perfectly balanced).

Additionally, the design of non-numeric variables is also checked to see
if they are *nested* within the groups or is they are *crossed*. This is
indicated by the `Design` column.

### Heterogeneity bias

Variables that vary both within and between groups can cause a
heterogeneity bias (*Bell and Jones, 2015*). It is recommended to center
(person-mean centering) those variables to avoid this bias. See
[`datawizard::demean()`](https://easystats.github.io/datawizard/reference/demean.html)
for further details. Use
[`summary()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/summary.html) to get a short text
result that indicates if and which predictors are possibly affected by
heterogeneity bias.
