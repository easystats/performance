# Proper Scoring Rules

Calculates the logarithmic, quadratic/Brier and spherical score from a
model with binary or count outcome.

## Usage

``` r
performance_score(model, verbose = TRUE, ...)
```

## Arguments

- model:

  Model with binary or count outcome.

- verbose:

  Toggle off warnings.

- ...:

  Arguments from other functions, usually only used internally.

## Value

A list with three elements, the logarithmic, quadratic/Brier and
spherical score.

## Details

Proper scoring rules can be used to evaluate the quality of model
predictions and model fit. `performance_score()` calculates the
logarithmic, quadratic/Brier and spherical scoring rules. The spherical
rule takes values in the interval `[0, 1]`, with values closer to 1
indicating a more accurate model, and the logarithmic rule in the
interval `[-Inf, 0]`, with values closer to 0 indicating a more accurate
model.

For
[`stan_lmer()`](https://mc-stan.org/rstanarm/reference/stan_glmer.html)
and
[`stan_glmer()`](https://mc-stan.org/rstanarm/reference/stan_glmer.html)
models, the predicted values are based on
[`posterior_predict()`](https://mc-stan.org/rstantools/reference/posterior_predict.html),
instead of [`predict()`](https://rdrr.io/r/stats/predict.html). Thus,
results may differ more than expected from their non-Bayesian
counterparts in **lme4**.

## Note

Code is partially based on
[GLMMadaptive::scoring_rules()](https://drizopoulos.github.io/GLMMadaptive/reference/scoring_rules.html).
