Cook’s distance removes one observation time checks corresponding influence model time (Cook 1977), flags observation large influence. view authors, several outliers, process removing single outlier time problematic model remains “contaminated” influenced possible outliers model, rendering method suboptimal presence multiple outliers. However, distribution-based approaches silver bullet either, cases usage methods agnostic theoretical statistical models interest might problematic. example, tall person expected also much heavier average, still fit expected association height weight (.e., line model weight ~ height). contrast, using multivariate outlier detection methods may flag person outlier—unusual two variables, height weight—even though pattern fits perfectly predictions. example , plot raw data see two possible outliers. first one falls along regression line, therefore “line” hypothesis. second one clearly diverges regression line, therefore can conclude outlier may disproportionate influence model. Scatter plot height weight, two extreme observations: one model-consistent (top-right) , model-inconsistent (.e., outlier; bottom-right). Using either z-score MCD methods, model-consistent observation incorrectly flagged outlier influential observation. contrast, model-based detection method displays desired behaviour: correctly flags person tall light, without flagging person tall heavy. leverage method (Cook’s distance) correctly distinguishes true outlier model-consistent extreme observation), based fitted model. Finally, unusual observations happen naturally: extreme observations expected even taken normal distribution. statistical models can integrate “expectation”, multivariate outlier methods might conservative, flagging many observations despite belonging right generative process. reasons, believe model-based methods still preferable MCD using supported regression models.
